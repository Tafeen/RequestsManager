It's simple and clear http requests manager written in python that allows to:
* Create http requests
    * Edit request headers
    * Edit request body
    * Set own request name
    * Add note to request
* Send requests and display response

* Store created requests locally (In future will be extended to store requests and share it with collaborators)
